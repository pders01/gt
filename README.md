## Usage

### Basic Connection

```bash
gt <host>                 # Connect to a host
gt <host> <command>       # Run command on host
```

### List Available Hosts

```bash
gt list                   # List all available hosts
```

### File Transfer (SCP)

```bash
# Upload files to remote host
gt -s myserver local1.txt local2.txt remote/path/   # Upload local files to remote path

# Download files from remote host
gt -s myserver :remote/file1.txt local/path/        # Download remote file to local path
gt -s myserver :remote/dir/* local/path/            # Download all files in remote dir

# Note: Remote paths must be prefixed with ':' when downloading
```

### Options

```bash
gt -u root <host>       # Connect as root user
gt -s <host>            # Use SCP instead of SSH
gt --config ~/.ssh/custom_config <host>  # Use custom config file
```

```ssh-config
# In ~/.ssh/config
Include ~/.ssh/config.d/*

    HostName dev.example.com
    User developer
    Port 2222

    HostName prod.example.com
    User admin
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/prod_key
```
