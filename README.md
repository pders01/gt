gt <host> <command>       # Run command on host
```

### List Available Hosts
```bash
gt list                   # List all available hosts
NO_COLOR=1 gt list       # List hosts without colors
```

### Options
```bash
gt -u root <host>        # Connect as root user
gt -s <host>            # Use SCP instead of SSH
gt --config ~/.ssh/custom_config <host>  # Use custom config file
```

## Configuration

# In ~/.ssh/config
Include ~/.ssh/config.d/*

Host dev
    HostName dev.example.com
    User developer
    Port 2222

    HostName prod.example.com
    User admin
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/prod_key
```

## Options

- `-s, --scp`: Use SCP instead of SSH
- `-c, --config`: Specify custom SSH config file path
- `--help`: Show help message

## Environment Variables

- `NO_COLOR`: Disable colored output when set (follows [no-color.org](https://no-color.org) convention)
